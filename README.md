# Shopping Cart Project
Build a shopping cart app using tests
Theme will be a watch shop

# Make a simple app that respects at least the following :
Should have at least 2 routes (home and shopping page)
Home page
Shopping page
A shopping cart

On the shopping cart route, user should see sticky bar which displays number of items in the cart

A button should be present so the user can go to the cart to checkout and pay (simulation)

Every product should be represented as a card that the user can add to the cart, by specifying the quantity
Increment and Decrement
Add to Cart functionality 


# Structure of the App
Header (Home / Shop - routes as links) + a shopping cart
Content
Routes logic should be here, as in the header, there will be links to navigate between Home page and Shopping page

# Routes
Will bring the selected page to the Content div

# Header
Can add Logo, link to Home and link to Shopping, and the shopping cart itself

# Content
Basically where all the 'dynamic' content will appear
Home Page content
Shopping page content

# Simulation
User opens page => show home page
user clicks on shopping page => show shopping page
user clicks on a product => show product?

# Home Page

# Shopping Page
shows all products as cards

# Product card
Could add another page when user clicks on an individual card to display the product in full
Or keep product in the page, and add a kind of submenu when user clicks

In any case, user should be able to click on a product
Choose the quantity by incrementing or decrementing the quantity
Should be able to add the item 

# Shopping Cart
Must be available across all pages
Must update as soon as the user adds a product
Must list all added products and give the total price
